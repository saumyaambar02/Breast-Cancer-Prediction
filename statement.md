# Problem Statement**  

The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify breast tumors as 
malignant or benign based on numerical features extracted from Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) images .  

Objectives :    

- Analyzes tumor characteristics such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, and smoothness     

- Learns the patterns differentiating malignant and benign tumors    

- Achieves higher accuracy than manual diagnosis     

- Helps in early detection and reduces human error. 

## Scope of the Project** 

The main scope of this project is to build a machine learning model that can help in early breast cancer detection
as early diagnosis increases the chances of survival. Traditionally, doctors analyse cell images to 
determine whether the tumor is malignant or benign. However, this process can be time consuming as well as not 
so accurate as the main challenges to classify the tumor into benign or malignant. The report may vary from one doctor to another.So, to minimize time 
consumption and increased rate of accuracy, Machine learning offers a way 
to support doctors by automatically learning patterns from medical reports.  

## Target Users:

- Medical student  

- Researchers 

- Doctors 

- Diagnostic assistants 

- Software developers  

## High Level Features  

- Breast Cancer Dataset containing 30 FNA-based features and processes it.  
 
- Visualisaing the dataset using plots like histograms, heatmaps, pairplots, and scatterplots.  
 
- Data splitting into training and testing sets for proper model evaluation.   

- Trains an SVM classifier to separate malignant and benign tumor samples.  

- Predicts the type of a tumor (benign or malignant) based on input features.  

- Generates evaluation metrics including confusion matrix and classification report.  

- Provides a simple and easy to follow ML workflow for understanding to model development.
